# 🔁 Palindrome Checker (No Slicing!)

## 👩‍🏫 Intro to Computer Science – Ms. Liu  
**All instructional content created by Hilda Liu**  

## 🧑‍🏫 Project Overview

This beginner-friendly Python project helps students build a **palindrome checker** using **loops and string logic** — without using slicing (`[::-1]`).  

Students will write a simple program that:
- Asks for user input
- Reverses the word using a `for` loop
- Compares the original and reversed word
- Determines if it's a palindrome

📌 **Note:** This version does **not** handle spaces or punctuation.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By completing this project, students will:

- Use `input()` to get user text
- Apply `.lower()` to ignore casing
- Reverse a string using a loop
- Compare strings with `if`/`else`
- Understand how strings work in Python
